  CPP-UNet, an innovative convolutional neural network-based architecture designed for the segmentation of renal structures, including the kidneys themselves and renal masses (cysts and tumors), in a computed tomography (CT) scan. Particularly, we investigate the fusion of the Pyramid Pooling Module (PPM) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) for improving the UNet network by integrating contextual information across multiple scales.
